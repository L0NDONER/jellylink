########## EXPLANATION ##########
# 1. Updated WorkingDirectory to /home/martin/Desktop/python to ensure relative imports work.
# 2. Updated ExecStart to point specifically to watcher.py.
# 3. Kept existing security hardening (NoNewPrivileges/PrivateTmp) as they are best practices.
# 4. Added [Install] section which was missing in your snippet; this is required for 'systemctl enable' to work.
